# AIHACKCOVID

This repository has been made as part of the [AIHACKCOVID Hackathon](https://aihackcovid.aimedgroningen.com/), in an attempt to understand COVID-19 and the effectiveness of policies. You'll find our analysis in the Jupyter notebook in *notebooks/masks.ipynb*. Images generated by the notebook are placed in the *images* folder, and all data used can be found in the *data* folder.

Enjoy!
